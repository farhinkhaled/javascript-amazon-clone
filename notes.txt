- data attribute is a HTML attribute
    have to start with data then any name
        ex - data-name
- module is a better way to organize code 
    - module contains a variable inside a file 
    - not causes conflict with anything outside the file 
- <script type="module" src="scripts/amazon.js"></script> let's this file get variables out of other files  
    - export let cart = []; write "export" infront of those variables that will be used in other files 
    - import {cart} from '../data/cart.js'

- modules only work with live server 
- utils -> useful utility
- ../ -> go outside the current folder
- ./ -> mean go to current folder
