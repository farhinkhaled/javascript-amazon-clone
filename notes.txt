- data attribute is a HTML attribute
    have to start with data then any name
        ex - data-name
- module is a better way to organize code 
    - module contains a variable inside a file 
    - not causes conflict with anything outside the file 
- <script type="module" src="scripts/amazon.js"></script> let's this file get variables out of other files  
    - export let cart = []; write "export" infront of those variables that will be used in other files 
    - import {cart} from '../data/cart.js'

- modules only work with live server 
- utils -> useful utility
- ../ -> go outside the current folder
- ./ -> mean go to current folder
- ../../data/cart.js -> to get out of checkout folder then again to get out of scripts folder 
- external libraries -> code that is outside of a project 
- code compression is called minification 
- to use (js module + external libraries) use ESM version -> EcmaScript Module 
    EcmaScript is just another name for javascript 
    ESM - a version that works with js modules 

- export default functionName/variableName -> can import without curly bracket  
    each file can only have 1 default export 

- import with curly bracket is called named export 
- if localStorage causes problem then -> in console of webpage run localStorage.clear()
- MVC
    - model -> saves and manages data
    - view -> takes the data and displays it on page
    - controller -> runs some code when we interact with the page 
        ex - eventListener 
    model is used to generate the view and then when we interact with the view it will run the controller and the controller will update the model
        ex - cart is a model which has been used to generate HTML 

- main idea of js
    - save the data -> model
    - generate the HTML -> view
    - make it interactive 

- automated testing means using code to test code 
- .toFixed(2) returns a string, not a number.
- group of related tests is called test suit
- testing framework => external libraries that helps us write tests easier
    ex - jasmine
         jest (for reactjs)
         mochajs
- in jasmine spec is another name for test 
- expect(formatCurrency(0)).toEqual('0.00'); -> here expect gives an object 
-   describe('test suit: formatCurrency', () => {
        describe();
    }); -> we can use describe inside describe
